# gba-link-universal-test

This is a test ROM (based on [BeatBeast](https://github.com/afska/beat-beast)) that checks how the [LinkUniversal](https://github.com/afska/gba-link-connection?tab=readme-ov-file#-LinkUniversal) library behaves in the context of a 2-player game, with an audio player (in Direct Sound DMA mode) playing music, a background video, text and sprites.

The example sets the interval at around ~4 transfers per frame and sends 2 consecutive numbers on each frame. Each node validates that the numbers are consecutive, ensuring there are no repeated or missed packets. Also, each player can send extra packets to move the remote horse to the left or right. No audio pops should be audible on hardware.

- A pre-compiled ROM is available in the *Releases* section.
