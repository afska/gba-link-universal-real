# gba-link-universal-test

This is a test ROM (based on [BeatBeast](https://github.com/afska/beat-beast)) that tests how the [LinkUniversal](https://github.com/afska/gba-link-connection?tab=readme-ov-file#-LinkUniversal) library behaves in the context of a game, with DMA messing around in the background, playing audio, video, text and sprites.
